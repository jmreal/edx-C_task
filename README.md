task1

You decide to bet on the final match of the Tug of War National Championship. 

Prior to the match the names and weights of the players are presented, alternating by team (team 1 player 1, team 2 player 1, team 1 player 2, and so on). There is the same number of players on each side. You record the player weights as they are presented and calculate a total weight for each time to inform your bet. You write a C program to assist with this.

Your program should first read an integer indicating the number of members per team. Then, the program should read the player weights (integers representing kilograms) alternating by team. 

After calculating the total weight of each team, the program should display the text "Team X has an advantage" (replacing X with 1 or 2 depending on which team has a greater total weight).

You will then display the text "Total weight for team 1:" followed by the weight of team 1, then "Total weight for team 2:" followed by the weight of team 2 (see example below).

You are guaranteed that the two teams will not have the same total weight.


Task 2


The most popular, human-readable way to write an IP (to be precise, IPv4) is to write four numbers separated with dots (e.g., 127.0.0.1). But an IP address can also be written as a 32-bit number.

To get this form, you must multiply all the parts of the IP number by powers of 256 (256*256*256, 256*256, 256 and 1 - don't use precomputed versions).

Write a program that asks the user to provide four numbers, and then checks if these numbers are more than or equal to 0, and less than or equal to 255.

Next, the program should write both forms of the IP address: the human-readable one and the 32-bit-number one.

Use the unsigned long int type; to print it, use the "%lu" format in the printf function.

If any of the address parts doesn't meet the given criteria (0<=x<=255), print only this simple error message: Inccorect IP Address..

Your version of the program must print the same result as the expected output.
